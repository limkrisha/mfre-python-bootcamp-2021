# Google Colab

For this workshop and the Analytics course next semester, we will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). All you need is a working Gmail account.  

  - No need to install any software 
  - Works on Windows and MacOS
  - Can easily share with colleagues

Keyboard shortcuts
  - `Ctrl + Enter` to run
  - `Ctrl + M + B` to insert code chunk

# Try it out

```{python}
2 + 2
print("Hello World")

```

---
# Strings, integers, and floats

In Python, the assignment operator is `=`. 

To review the value of a variable, we can type the name of the variable into the interpreter and press Enter/Return. 

However, to display output in a script, we have to use the `print` function. 

```{python}
text = "Data Carpentry"
number = 42
pi_value = 3.1415

text
print(number)
```


---
# Strings, integers, and floats

Everything in Python has a type. To get the type of something, we can pass it to the built-in function `type`

  - **Strings** hold sequences of characters, which can be letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.
  - **Integers** are positive or negaitve whole numbers with no decimal points
  - **Floats** are real numbers and can be written with a decimal point

```{python}
type(text)
```

```{python}
type(number)
```

```{python}
type(pi_value)
```

---
# Operators

We can perform mathematical calculations in Python using the basic operators `+, -, /, *, %`

```{python}
2 + 2 # Addition

6 * 7 # Multiplication

2 ** 16 # Power

13 % 5 # Modulo

```

---
# Operators

We can also use comparison and logic operators: `<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=` and statements of identity such as `and, or, not`. The data type returned is called **boolean**.

```{python}
3 > 4 

True and True

True or False

True and False
```

---
# Lists

**Lists** are the most fundamental data structure in Python. It is used to hold an ordered sequence of elements.

We build a list using square brackets.

```{python}
country = ["canada", "usa", "china", "japan"]
gdp = [44100, 55700, 16200, 39300]
carbon = [15.3, 16.6, 7.06, 9.14]

country
type(country)
len(country)
```

---
# Lists

Lists can also contain different data types. Lists can also contain lists. 

```{python}
example1 = ["canada", 15.3, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14]

example2 = [["canada", 15.3],
            ["usa", 16.6],
            ["china", 7.06],
            ["japan", 9.14]]
            
print(example1)

print(example2)
print("length of example2:", len(example2))
```

---
# Lists

Each element in a list can be accessed by an index. 

**Note that Python indexes start with 0 instead of 1.**

```{python}
example1 = ["canada", 15.3, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14]

example2 = [["canada", 15.3],
            ["usa", 16.6],
            ["china", 7.06],
            ["japan", 9.14]]
            
print("China's carbon emissions is", example1[5])
print("Japan's carbon emissions is", example2[3][1])
```

---
# Lists

We can also slice lists, or select multiple elements from a list. In general, where it starts is included, where it ends is excluded, i.e., `[start_index:end_index]`

You can also print the index of a certain value in a list

```{python}
example1 = ["canada", 15.3, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14]

print(example1[2:6])
print(example1[:4])
print(example1[4:])
print("The index of 7.06 is", example1.index(7.06))
```

---
# Lists

We can also change the value of the elements in a list. For example, we can change the value of Canada's emission from 15.3 to 16.3.

```{python}
example1 = ["canada", 15.3, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14]

example1[1] = 16.3

print(example1)
```

---
# Lists

If we want to replace Canada to South Korea

```{python}
example1 = ["canada", 15.3, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14]

example1[0:2] = ["south korea", 12.9]

print(example1)
```

---
# Lists

If we want to add Canada back

```{python}
example1_can = example1 + ["canada", 15.3]

print(example1_can)
```
---
# Lists

We can delete elements using the `del` function. For example, we can delete South Korea from our list.

```{python}
example1_can_append = ["south korea", 12.9, "usa", 16.6, "china", 7.06, "japan", 9.14, "canada", 15.3]

del(example1_can_append[0:2])
print(example1_can_append)
```

---
# Lists

We can also take the sum of elements in a list using the `sum` function.

```{python}
carbon = [15.3, 16.6, 7.06, 9.14]

print(sum(carbon))
```
